    <h2>Pros and Cons of Semantic Databases</h2>
  </center>
    <p>
      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Compared to Folksonomy, in the case of Semantic Databases there’s no need to remember a
            certain name the initial designer used to describe a well-known concept when searching
            for old data, since we are dealing with well-defined concepts which remain the same.</li>
        <li>Without semantic data, the owners of separate SQL databases would have to decide on
            a common data format to share information that they could both understand. Unfortunately,
            this requires human intervention.</li>
        <li>Generating a RDF graph from a relational database is relatively easy, for example we could
            use RDB2RDF.</li>
        <li>It could be a valuable tool for Engineering Analysis, considering it involves handling
            elaborate data sets, using complex queries. In this situation we can identify the following
            advantages:
            <ul>
              <li>There is no need for an expensive Product Data Management system.</li>
              <li>A variety of checklist analysis could be conducted simultaneously.</li>
            </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Disadvantages:
      <ul>
        <li>It’s difficult to agree on a common complex ontology (for a simpler one we have solutions
            as DCMI or FOAF)</li>
        <li>Semantic Web Databases that handle personal data will have to reinforce their privacy
            policies even more, since a potential attacker could take advantage of the ease with
            which information is correlated in this paradigm.</li>
        <li>One potential disadvantage is that for big databases adding the metadata into OWL
            semantic mark-ups is a lengthy process.</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, there are still a few resources that could educate new users as
            of when and how to apply Semantic Web technologies in real world scenarios, making
            overly saturated technologies such as SQL more convenient.</li>
      </ul>
