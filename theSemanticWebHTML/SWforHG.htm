    <h2>How will Semantic Web help Governments?</h2>
  </center>
<br>


  <div style="padding:0% 15%;">

    <p>
    No matter where you fall in debates over free software,
    there's one type of information that is unarguably meant to be free,
    and that's information about our government.
    </p><p>


    The more knowledge citizens have about government the better.
    So how can we use the Semantic Web to make it easier to get that knowledge, and to foster civic participation?
    </p><p>

    Every government stores data about its people and its institutions.
    This data can vary from high school enrollment to proposed bills.
    If this data is stored keeping in mind an Ontology and using RDFa, users of the database will have much more power at their command.
    </p><p>
    The data will be connected by relationships.
    It is these relationships between data that will enable users to perform even more accurate searches.

    Excerpt <br> <br>
  </center>

    <ul style="padding:0% 30%">
      <li>
        Open government data refers to the information collected,
       produced or paid for by the public bodies and made freely available for reuse.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Data which is not privacy sensitive can be published as open data with an open license.
         This means you can find information on almost all subjects,
         such as the schedule of your bus or the quality of water.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        The digital economy revolves around data.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Data is the new raw material and with open data we have this material in abundance.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Open data can help public administrations work more efficiently and improve the quality of their services.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        It can help businesses enhance their existing business models or venture into new ones.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        It can also provide information to citizens for example on their neighborhood or local government.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        The reuse of open data can further boost the economy and play a key
        role in our daily lives helping us save time.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        The European data portal catalogues all data public administrations published across Europe
        <br>
        for reuse by application developers interested journalists students or just anyone of us.

      <h2>
      Example US website : govtrack.us
      </h2>
      The US government has been posting relevant information online, but in scattered locations.
      For instance, legislation is posted in one place and votes on the very same legislation in another.
      Gathering the information in one place and in a common format gives rise to new ways of mixing the information together. <br>
      <br>
      <h2>
        Questions you can ask:
      </h2>
      1) What's the population of each senator's state? <br>
      2) Which state has more politicians who have proposed bills for Topic X? <br>

      <br>
      This gives immense power to the people of the nation.
      The dataset can be manipulated for various uses.
      The most important factor is that results are more accurate than current search engines. <br>

    </p>



    <p>
      Due to the power of the dataset, anyone can search about the politicians
      representing a particular state.
      One can find out the bills proposed by them and understand the changes
      that the particular politician preaches for.

      <br>
      <br>

      Below is an example from the govtrack.us website:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Search for political representatives of a state
        </li>
        <li>
          Visit their personal page
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at the bills they have sponsored
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at their voting record
        </li>
      </ol>

      Scientists using Semantic Web enabled Databases
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tim Berners Lee vigorously campaigned for Open Data and Linked Data in a TED talk given by him.
      Most research is conducted separately and the data is stored in different locations.
      If this data would be made Semantic Web enabled using Ontologies and RDFa, Scientists would be able to get an exponentially higher degree of accuracy.
      <br> <br>

      A scientist may ask : "What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?"
      Google does not have an accurate answer for this query but a Semantic Web enabled database gives 32 accurate results. (Shown below)
