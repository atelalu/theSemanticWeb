    <h2>How will Semantic Web help Governments?</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">
    No matter where you fall in debates over free software,  <br>
    there's one type of information that is unarguably meant to be free, <br>
    and that's information about our government. <br>

    <br>

    The more knowledge citizens have about government the better. <br>
    So how can we use the Semantic Web to make it easier to get that knowledge, and to foster civic participation?

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Every government stores data about its people and its institutions. <br>
    This data can vary from high school enrollment to proposed bills. <br>
    If this data is stored keeping in mind an Ontology and using RDFa, users of the database will have much more power at their command.  <br>
    <br>
    The data will be connected by relationships.  <br>
    It is these relationships between data that will enable users to perform even more accurate searches. <br>

    <h2>
      European Data Portal (EDP)
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      This is an example of an initiative towards a world of Open Linked Data. <br>
      There are numerous datasets available online from various countries. <br>
      Furthermore, anyone can run SPARQL queries on this website.

      <h2>
        Example US website : govtrack.us
      </h2> 
      The US government has been posting relevant information online, but in scattered locations. <br>
      For instance, legislation is posted in one place and votes on the very same legislation in another. <br> 
      Gathering the information in one place and in a common format gives rise to new ways of mixing the information together. <br>
      <br>
      <h2>
        Questions you can ask:
      </h2> 
      1) What's the population of each senator's state? <br>
      2) Which state has more politicians who have proposed bills for Topic X <br>

      <br>
      This gives immense power to the people of the nation. <br>
      The dataset can be manipulated for various uses. <br>
      The most important factor is that results are more accurate than current search engines. <br>

    <h2>
      Scientists using Semantic Web enabled Databases 
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Tim Berners Lee vigorously campaigned for Open Data and Linked Data in a TED talk given by him. <br>
      Most research is conducted separately and the data is stored in different locations. <br>
      If this data would be made Semantic Web enabled using Ontologies and RDFa, Scientists will be able to get an exponentially higher degree of accuracy. <br>
      A scientist may ask : "What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?" <br>
      Google does not have an accurate answer for this query but a Semantic Web enabled database gives 32 accurate results. (Shown below)<br>
