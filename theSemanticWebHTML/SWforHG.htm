    <h2>How will Semantic Web help Governments?</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">
    No matter where you fall in debates over free software or DRM, there's one type of information that is unarguably meant to be free, and that's information about our government. 
    <br>
    The more knowledge citizens have about government the better. 
    <br>
    So how can we use the Semantic Web to make it easier to get that knowledge, and to foster civic participation?

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Every government stores data about its people and its institutions. <br>
    This data can vary from high school enrollment to proposed bills. <br>
    If this data is stored keeping in mind an Ontology and using RDFa, users of the database will have much more power at their command.  <br>
    The data will be connected by relationships.  <br>
    It is these relationships between data that will enable users to perform even more accurate searches. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>
      Scientists using Semantic Web enabled Databases
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Tim Berners Lee vigorously campaigned for Open Data and Linked Data in a TED talk given by him. <br>
      Most research is conducted separately and the data is stored in different locations. <br>
      If this data would be made Semantic Web enabled using Ontologies and RDFa, Scientists will be able to get an exponentially higher degree of accuracy. <br>
      A scientist may ask : "What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?" <br>
      Google does not have an accurate answer for this query but a Semantic Web enabled database gives 32 accurate results. (Shown below)<br>
